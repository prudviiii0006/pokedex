# x402 Examples

Reference implementations of x402 clients, servers, and facilitators. Explore different patterns for integrating x402 into your applications.

## Client Examples

Five client implementations showing different approaches to the x402 payment protocol:

### **fetch/** — Native Fetch API
- **Complexity:** Low
- **Use when:** Building modern JavaScript/TypeScript apps with the native fetch API
- **Key feature:** Transparent 402 handling with async/await

### **axios/** — Axios Interceptor
- **Complexity:** Low
- **Use when:** You already have Axios in your codebase and want to add payment without refactoring
- **Key feature:** Global interceptor injecting payment logic automatically

### **custom/** — Raw Protocol Implementation
- **Complexity:** High
- **Use when:** You need deep understanding of x402 or building custom wallet/hardware integration
- **Key feature:** Step-by-step manual payment flow with full control

### **advanced/** — Enterprise Features
- **Complexity:** High
- **Use when:** You need multi-network support, lifecycle hooks, or payment preferences
- **Key feature:** Builder pattern, network preference selection, lifecycle observers

### **mcp/** — Model Context Protocol
- **Complexity:** Medium
- **Use when:** You want AI agents to autonomously pay for and consume APIs
- **Key feature:** Enables Claude and other LLMs to discover, pay for, and call protected endpoints

## Server & Facilitator

### **server/hono/** — Resource Server
The policy enforcer. Protects your API endpoints with x402 payment requirements. Issues 402 responses with pricing and merchant information. All actual payment verification is delegated to the Facilitator.

### **server/bazaar-integration/** — Bazaar Discovery
Resource server with GoPlausible Bazaar catalog integration. Endpoints are automatically discoverable in the public Bazaar marketplace after real payments settle. Three example endpoints showcase GET and POST discovery patterns.

### **facilitator/basic/** — Settlement Service
The truth machine. Verifies payment signatures, submits transactions to Algorand, and confirms on-chain settlement. Stateless and trustless—never holds keys or funds.

## Testing Clients

**Requirements:**
- Algorand TestNet account with ALGO and USDC
- Environment variables configured (see each client's README)

**Basic Setup:**

1. **Start the server** (in one terminal):
   ```bash
   cd server/hono
   pnpm install
   pnpm start
   ```

2. **Run your client** (in another terminal):
   ```bash
   cd client/fetch  # or axios, custom, advanced, mcp
   pnpm install
   pnpm start
   ```

3. **Optional: Run the Facilitator** (in a third terminal):
   ```bash
   cd facilitator/basic
   pnpm install
   pnpm start
   ```

**Important:** Make sure your client and server are pointing to the correct endpoints in their `.env` files, or hardcoded in.
