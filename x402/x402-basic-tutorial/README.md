# x402 Basic Tutorial

This folder follows the [x402 on Algorand tutorial](https://dev.algorand.co/resources/x402-on-algorand/) from the Algorand Developer Portal.

## Structure

- **client/** — Client that pays for API access
- **server/** — Resource server that charges for endpoints with Bazaar discovery catalog listing

## Bazaar Discovery

The server integrates with the [GoPlausible Bazaar](https://facilitator.goplausible.xyz/discovery/resources), a public marketplace where endpoints are automatically cataloged after payments settle. Agents and buyers can discover and autonomously call your protected resources. Metadata (URL, method, price, schema) is declared once per route and flows into the catalog on first real payment settlement.

## Quick Start


### 1. Prerequisites

- Node.js LTS or newer with pnpm
- Algorand TestNet account with ALGO and USDC
- See [Setup section](https://dev.algorand.co/resources/x402-on-algorand/#setup) in the tutorial

**Note:** On first run, you may need to approve esbuild for pnpm. If you see a build error, run:

```bash
pnpm approve-builds
```

as described in the x402 dev portal tutorial above.

### 2. Test with Hosted Services (Simplest)

1. Add your mnemonic to `client/.env`
2. Run the client:
   ```bash
   cd client
   pnpm install
   pnpm start
   ```

The client will connect to the hosted resource server and facilitator automatically.

### 3. Run Locally (Full Control)

#### Start the server:
```bash
cd server
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

#### Start the client (in another terminal):
```bash
cd client
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

### 4. Self-Hosted Facilitator (Advanced)

To run your own facilitator for complete control, see the [x402-examples/facilitator/basic](../x402-examples/facilitator/basic) folder for setup instructions.
